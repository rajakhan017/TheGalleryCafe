# TheGalleryCafe


Welcome to the repository for The Gallery Cafe's website task. This project is designed to practice various HTML tags and elements. Let's break down the different sections of the webpage and see which HTML tags were used.

## Screenshots and Explanations

### About Us Section

In this section, we have used heading tags `<h2>` for "About Us" and `<p>` tag for the Lorem ipsum text. Here's how it looks:

### Rate Us and Follow Us Section

This part contains anchor tags `<a>` for "Rate Us" and "Follow us". These create hyperlinks to external pages. Here's a screenshot:

### Menu Section

In the menu section, we've utilized various tags. For the headings, we used `<h2>` tags. The lists are created using `<ul>` (unordered lists) and `<li>` (list items) tags. Here's how it looks:

## Learning

Through this task, you'll gain practical experience with opening and closing tags, nesting elements, using basic tags like `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>`, and creating different sections of a webpage.

Please note that you need to replace `/screenshots/about_us.png`, `/screenshots/rate_follow.png`, `/screenshots/menu.png`, and `/screenshots/contact.png` with the actual paths to your screenshots. Also, replace `your-username` with your GitHub username in the repository URL and the hosted link.

Upload your screenshots to your GitHub repository along with the README.md file. This README should now give a clear overview of the different sections of your "The Gallery Cafe" webpage and the HTML tags used to create them.
